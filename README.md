# The First Ever Nicktober Video Game!

Welcome to THE MANY FACES OF NICKTOBER a.k.a NICK GAME! First off, if you don't know who Nick is and are otherwise not a participant of Nicktober, don't worry! The game can be played by anyone and you're all allowed to participate in the leaderboard. If you played Super Mario 64 DS you might recognize the game loop, that's because this project started as an exploration of Raylib, and as a starting point I chose to recreate one or my favourite mini games of all time.

For those interested in a version that is more true to the original DS version, and perhaps the rest of the SM64DS minigames, keep an eye on my GitHub page.

## About NICK GAME

The game is built in C++ using Raylib which means no overhead that comes from usual game engines (the actual game is only 2mb!). The entire package however, is much larger because of the number of soundfiles included in the game.

## "Installation"

As this is my first time actually distributing a binary that many people will use, there's no actual "installation" process and instead it's **as simple as extracting a zip**. Select the latest release from the Releases on the right hand side and extract the contents to a folder. We recommend it's own folder since wanted_.exe will generate files in its directory to store player data.

You can get the zip on the right side of the screen here.

Make sure you choose the zip.

## Accessing the Leaderboard

The current state of the leaderboard can be viewed <a href="http://hamel111.myweb.cs.uwindsor.ca/sm64games/wanted/leaderboard.php" target="_blank" >here</a>. At the end of each game you will also be presented with the top 5 scores in both the All Players and Nicktober categories.

## About Nicktober

For any non-participants in Nicktober, I have included here a brief explanation of what it is. Nicktober is a month long "game-show" hosted by Nicolas Alfonso Duronio in honor of his own greatness. Earnestly, Nicolas is a wonderful kid who places tremendous value in his relationships with his friends, and often finds himself fulfilling the role of host for many group events we have in our circle. Nicktober is not about Nick for any reason other than to be funny: it's really about the celebration of our relationship not just with Nick but with each other.

That is part of the reason I happily submit all the effort in building this project to the festivities of Nicktober; I can't afford to miss a chance to tell my friends what they mean to me.

If you aren't a Nicktober participant but you're here, thank you. I hope you felt it was worth the time ♥️

## Customization

You may notice the resources folder structure: it is possible to add/remove .O files to each of the subdirectories and when the game starts it will change accordingly. The same is true for the texture files, however editing this is a little more challenging if you're not familiar with sprite atlases. Here you can find a version of the sprite atlas with all the regions clearly defined, if you're interested in making your own skin for the game. If you do make any customizations please send them to me because I'd love to see what you come up with.

> **Note:** The names of the files don't actually have to be anything specific, only the file types themselves (.PNG for atlas, .O for sound) and their location
